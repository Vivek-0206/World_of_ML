# Basic path to learn Practical Machine Learning.

## Prerequisite

- [x] High school math(vectors, matrices, calculus, probability, and stats) 
- [x] Basic Python Help
- [x] Must have Patience to learn new things

---

## Motivation

1. ### Watch [`AI For Everyone`](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone) By [`Andrew Ng`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng)
    - The meaning behind common AI terminology, including neural networks, machine learning, deep learning, and data science.
    - What AI realistically can--and cannot--do.
    - How to spot opportunities to apply AI to problems in your own organization.
    - What it feels like to build machine learning and data science projects.
    - How to work with an AI team and build an AI strategy in your company.
    - How to navigate ethical and societal discussions surrounding AI.
  
2. ### YouTube Originals [`AGE OF AI`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjq6DwYksrzz_fsWIpPcf6V7p2RNAneKc)

## Started learning

### Stage-0

1. Understand basic of machine learning
    - Supervised Learning
    - Unsupervised Learning
    - Classification and Regression
    
2. Learn python and some useful library
    - Pandas
      > Pandas is a popular Python library for data analysis.
    - NumPy
      > NumPy is a very popular python library for large multi-dimensional array and matrix processing,
    - Matplotlib
      > Matpoltlib is a very popular Python library for data visualization.
      
3. Setup Local Machine with latest [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/)
    > Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python

### Stage-1

1. How to use data from verious source like [[`Kaggle` ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  [` UCI ml repo`](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)]

2. Start to use `Jupyter notebook` A complate IDE for data science and machine learning

3. Started hand on practice with [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

4. Use [`scikit-learn map`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html) and `documentation`


### Stage-2

- now, you are a little bit comfortable with coding it's time to learn basic maths behind algorithms. 

- Take a Andrew's [`Course`](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 

### Stege-3

- Learn `Deep-learning` || `neural network`

- Learn about popular library [[`TensorFlow` ](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)  [` PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)]
- `TensorFlow` is backed by Google Brain team and `PyTorch` is eveloped by Facebook's AI Research lab. Both have large community.

- In neural network
  1. ANN (artificial neural network)
  2. CNN (Convolutional neural network)
  3. RNN (Recurrent neural networks)
  4. Autoencoder

## _Happy coding and have a good time learning how to make machines smarter._
